# JavaScript Tasks

Complete the following JavaScript tasks. You can write your code directly in this file or create separate JavaScript files if you prefer.

## Task 1: Array Manipulation

- Write a function named `getEvenNumbers` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the even numbers from the original array.

### Testing Task 1

To test the implementation of Task 1, follow these steps:

1. **Install Jest**:
   Make sure you have Jest installed. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Tests**:
   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

   This will run the tests for Task 1 and display the results in your terminal.

## Task 2: DOM Interaction

- Create a button element with the text "Change Text".
- When the button is clicked, change the text content of an existing HTML element with the id "myText" to "Hello, Check!".

### Testing Task 2

To test the implementation of Task 2, open the `domInteraction.html` file in a web browser and click the "Change Text" button. The text content of the element with the id "myText" should change to "Hello, Check!".

## Task 3: Basic Fetch

- Fetch data from the following API endpoint: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos`
- Display the titles of the first 5 todos in an unordered list on the page.
